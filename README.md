# uwp-samples
Universal Windows Platform app samples

These samples demonstrate some Windows 10 features which are poorly documented.
So I decided to create these samples as reminders for my futur developments
and for others developers who want to use these features.

If you want others complex samples for wincomposition, [see the offical GitHub repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/WindowsUIDevLabs)
